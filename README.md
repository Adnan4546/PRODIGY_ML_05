The project aims to develop a machine learning model that accurately recognizes food items from images and estimates their calorie content. This will enable users to easily track their dietary intake and make informed food choices. The process involves several steps, including data preprocessing, model training, and calorie estimation.

Key Features of the Code:
Data Collection and Preprocessing:
The model uses a dataset of labeled food images. Images are resized and normalized to make them suitable for feeding into the model.

Model Architecture:
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is employed to classify different types of food items from the images. CNNs are highly effective for image recognition tasks due to their ability to capture spatial hierarchies.

Calorie Estimation:
Once the food item is recognized, a mapping of each food type to its average calorie content is used to estimate the calories in the detected food item. This mapping can be extended with more detailed nutrition information.

Model Evaluation:
The model's accuracy in recognizing food items is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. Cross-validation is applied to ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data.

User Interface:
A simple interface is provided to allow users to upload images of food. The system returns both the recognized food item and an estimated calorie count, helping users track their diet.

The model can be further improved by adding more food categories, refining calorie estimation based on portion size, and integrating user feedback for continuous learning.
